Do you ever just feel *on edge*? Like your state of happiness and bliss are being tested on such a fragile equilibrium that any second, minute or day now, it will surely tip over and shatter your entire illusion of peace. I know it's stupid to think that the happiness we feel will always be there but doesn't it frighten you knowing that your future will inevitably be filled with so much pain. It doesn't matter how far you go to avoid those situations, life will always be able to find a way to make you experience the art of pain. 

 <br/>

Personally, I don't like to put myself in those uncomfortable situations. Frankly, I try my best to avoid situations that make me feel uncomfortable or anxious. 

 <br/>

It's scary. 

 <br/>

Not knowing what's over that mountain, behind the next door, or simply the future of tomorrow. 

 <br/>

But despite the ups and downs that I have experienced, I do look back now knowing deep down I would not change the past. There is something so bittersweet and strange about letting the ugly stay in your life. By being completely honest with yourself enough that you can acknowledge how your own personal turmoil can mold who you are. But here's the interesting thing about your experiences, they can either shape you or break you. You can either make decisions out of instinct and let your emotions take the reins or you can bite your tongue, unclench your fists and walk away. 

 <br/>

It takes a certain level of patience to hustle through the hardships. To not feel distraught and horrible 24/7 because the universe is seemingly conspiring your miseries (at least that's what you believe during those moments). And I can think of countless times where I could have lashed out, blamed others for my situations, pity myself, envy others because they didn't understand what I felt; but after going through a fair amount of hardships, I realized something. At the end of the day, there is only so much you can do. Truly. A time where you have to draw the line and just take a breath and be patient. 

 <br/>

But there is one thing to keep in mind. Actually try to engrave this into your head. Because this is important to remember. 

 <br/>

No matter how difficult or stressful or downward the situation may be going, NEVER give up hope. 

 <br/>

This pain that you feel right now, you have to believe that it will get better. And I'm not telling you to just sit there and wait for it to get better right from the beginning, you have to go out and try to heal your own wounds. But *after* you have offered everything you can possibly do onto the table, just be patience and hopeful. 

 <br/>

And when if everything starts to feel hopeless, just take it one day at a time. And if that is too hard, than just take it an hour at a time. And if that's too hard then take it minute by minute. But if that is too much then don't even think about what's going to happen in the next second and live in the moment.
