So for the past few weeks I have been trying to piece together this puzzle in my head and figure out the answer to this question : what does it mean to be beautiful? 

<br/>

The answer is simple: *be yourself*

<br/>

WAIT WAIT WAIT!!! Don’t click off the site just yet. I know, I have heard that probably since I was in elementary school and little puppets would act out skits on morals and life’s only struggle was not getting the last seat on the swings during recess. But hear me out. As much as this cliche quote has been imbedded into the back of our minds, we ignore it. Or more often, we convince ourselves that we have changed or these people have shown me who I truly am. Which in some cases, that is true. I have been lucky enough to find people that unlock this better version of myself and push myself to always do better. But before you put a label on yourself and classify yourself a certain way, remember that there are so-called “methods” to know whether or not you are being honest with yourself. 

### Have the same values no matter who you are with.

 The moment you start thinking about how someone else will react or the perfect answer to satisfy others, that should be a huge red flag. If you are always trying to please others and need their validation to make you feel better, your values will be as sturdy as egg shells. Know what your values are and instead of preparing an answer that will appease those around you, say what you feel and from your heart. Because one of the hardest but most rewarding obstacle to tackle in your entire life is being yourself in a world that does the opposite.        

### Be proud of your limitations

It’s one thing to be proud of what you can do, but it’s whole other thing when you are proud of what you can’t do. When you can unapologetically accept your imperfections, your limitations in your life, it’s a testament that you know yourself better than anyone else and will have the confidence to make decisions and say “no” to others because you know that it will negatively affect yourself.  

### Be honest with your opinions

Whenever I have deep and sometimes controversial conversations with my friends or just acquaintances, I always try to be honest with my responses. This point sort of ties in with the first point since both circle around one thing: consistency. My biggest advice to those who have the constant urge to please others (which I once did), is to say what you mean but don’t say it mean. We can only do what we can do, which is tell the truth but if your honest response is not considerate and just downright offensive, you are being lazy and can do better. But how does being yourself the answer to being beautiful. Well first off, beauty is not objective at all and my own opinion is just my own, nothing set in stone. But the reason why I chose the word beautiful and not cute or pretty or sexy was because I don’t define beauty as just an exterior characteristic. Being beautiful is something that starts from inside and if your heart is not true to yourself and to others, it will become fragile. And in seconds, beauty will be turned into vanity. So be careful.

On a different hand, in my eyes, beauty reflects someone who exudes this confidence within themselves that isn’t boastful but blissful. They live their life being unapologetically themselves and have this energy of genuine happiness and energy around people because they accept every facet of who they are that there is no room from judgment or criticism or shame to put on others.
