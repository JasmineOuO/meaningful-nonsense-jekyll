### 1. Appreciating What You Already Have </br>

Now I don’t want to come off as preachy but I’m not one to necessarily sugar coat what I’m trying to get by. So hear me when I say this : life does not have to be perfect for you to be happy. Everyone is always going to be striving for better, setting new goals but we are all so focused on those things and when these random obstacles come into our lives and slap us in the face, we are so quick to become annoyed or frustrated for the rest of the day. What I want to ask you is that, when you achieve this goal of yours, is that when your happiness will begin? Will life suddenly become perfect? If your answer is yes, well damn I want to know what your goal is but if your answer is no like mine, then I want to ask yourself why you are making yourself suffer until you obtain this goal.  And as cheesy as this may sound, why not enjoy the journey instead of having the mindset of suffer now and be happy later. Which I call bullshit. Yes, I know, you may be going through some tedious school work or dealing with clients that are not the most pleasant company but it should not mean that your entire day or week is suddenly labeled sadness or annoyed on your emotions app on your phone. Don’t let those issues stop you from being present and living your life being grateful for what you already have. So the main point I’m trying to get across is that by appreciating and being grateful and aware of your surroundings and your privileges will break the curse of delayed happiness in your life.   </br>

### 2. Surround Yourself With the Right People  </br>

 I remember when I was in middle school and how real the struggle was to find friends. At the time, I defined friends as nice people and those who actually wanted to hang out with me. Yeah it was a pretty short definition but more importantly it was a crappy one. It may sound obvious to surround yourself with people that will make you happy but us teenagers are often poisoned by this dangerous snake called “peer pressure”. We all naturally as human beings want to fit in, feel accepted, so as a result, you begin to slowly change yourself to fit a certain clique’s mold. I remember how I used to play games that others were playing so I could fit in and hang out with them and it made me happy when I was with them, not because I enjoyed the games but because they didn’t make me feel lonely. And now I will  admit that loneliness is most certainly one of my biggest fears. This fear was definitely active when I first entered high school where I was not familiar with many people and sitting alone at lunch and taking the bus home by myself made me feel so...small. It’s a hard feeling to describe but it’s the sort of feeling you get when you are the last one to be chosen for gym class but like 24/7. But when I actually started making friends, I learned if you want true friends, you have to go and look for them. Don’t just wait for people come to you because I know that if I did that in my first few weeks of grade 9, I would have definitely been at different person now. Remember to find friends that will make you a better person. Surround yourself with people that will stop you when you’re doing something that will hurt yourself and encourage you when you are scared to keep going. But also remember that they are not your bodily organs, they have a life of their own too. So don’t feel jealous when they can’t always talk to you and be sure to keep in mind that friends are the cherry on top of an already good life. Don’t rely on them to give you all the happiness and support in the world because a relationship has to go both ways. </br>

### 3. Do Something That Will Help You Grow  </br>

Whenever you have free time, try not to always click Netflix or scroll through social media. Yes, I know it can be sooooooo difficult but trust me, if you are constantly doing the same repetitive leisure activities, you are being stagnant. And you should never be stagnant. Why do you ask? Well I know through personal experience that life just becomes boring and I feel like robot. But by doing something that is new puts me outside my comfort zone makes my life exciting. Whether it’s reading a new book, cooking or baking something you haven’t tried, picking up a new sport or a new instrument, all of these new skills will ultimately help you grow in your skills and expand your mentality. The key to actually do this is by not overthinking it. Stop thinking that it might be hard or whatever may go through your head and just start. Trust me, starting something is always the hardest step and it may be uncomfortable at first but you have to stretch a little. That’s the only way you will grow. :)   </br>
