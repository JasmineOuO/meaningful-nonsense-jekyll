Success in life is designed to be tough. Obstacles will come your way that make everything seem impossible. You’ll face dilemmas that lead to hardships. But through it all, there are lessons that will be learned. However, celebrities, activists even the youths of our generation, preach a very generic, yet famous, saying: “If you chase your dreams, they will come true.” Their message advocates an optimistic mindset, one that suggests all you have to do is chase your dreams, and you are 100% guaranteed to achieve them. What they fail to mention are the bumps in the road and at times, dreams can feel like nightmares. And that’s because success is hard to come by. Hidden in success are two essential factors: **accepting failure** and **taking risks**. Coupled together, failure and risk are the necessary evils we all need to conquer in order to be successful.

 <br/>

First and foremost: failure. Failure is an absolute vital component in your path to success. We’ve all experienced failure. And our first reaction is to quit and run away from that uncomfortable feeling. My failures in life have been a learning experience and helped me shape a personal philosophy based on 3 principles that will positively impact your life forever. Number 1: <u>don’t give up so easily</u>. At one point or another, we will stumble upon obstacles that are seemingly impossible and when we feel overwhelmed, it is very easy to convince ourselves to quit. However, giving up too soon could cause us to miss out on subsequent success. Think about Michael Jordan, the greatest basket player to ever play. He openly confessed that he had missed over 9,000 shots in his career. 26 times he was given the chance to score the game winning shot and missed. He failed *over* and *over* again in his life but **persevered** to win 6 championships! Number 2: <u>there is no such thing as failure</u>. Sometimes you try your best and succeed. However, sometimes you try your best and fail, but you learn from your mistakes and improve upon them until you succeed. We are constantly being told that if we try hard enough, we will succeed. But what if we do try our hardest and, the results still don’t measure up to someone’s definition of success? Then we are told that we did not try hard enough. Because more often than not, we measure our success or failure through the outcome, not the effort, which should not be the case. Robert Kiyosaki, the famed author of the Rich Dad Poor Dad books, put it well when he said, “Sometimes we win and sometimes we learn.” Number 3: <u>the past does not equal the future</u>. Our past failures don’t mean we will fail every time but it can leave us broken and deflated. We can succeed 1000 times but that one failure will wipe out all our previous accomplishments. 

<blockquote>The only thing keeping you for getting what you want, is the story you keep telling yourself about why you cannot have it</blockquote>
<cite>Anthony Robbins</cite> 

It is essential to remind ourselves that the recent setback is part of the process and to use failure as a tool towards success. But that decisions rests entirely up to you. 

 <br/>

This leads me to my next factor: taking risks. The majority of us are afraid to take risks. And maybe because we’re told that the world is a dangerous place and we ought to follow the path of least resistance. So we get stuck in our normal routines and feel safe. We become afraid at the thought of venturing outside the safe worlds we’ve built for ourselves. Because it makes us feel too uncomfortable. However, *being uncomfortable is what we need*. Stepping outside the boundaries and taking a risk by trying something different helps us learn new things about ourselves and, ultimately, makes us successful. Society tells us that staying within our comfort zone will give us a successful life. Go to school, work hard and you’ll be successful. **But what makes us successful?** We are deceived to believe that wealth, status, popularity and materialistic flamboyance are the supreme achievements in life. So, we convince ourselves that they are right and why do as we’re told. We complete our university educations, end up working jobs that we don’t enjoy, and buy things that we are told will makes us happier as a way to compensate for the dissatisfaction we feel in our heart. But why do we torture ourselves with such an unfulfilling future? The solution is simple. Stop thinking about the money, the status, or the materials, and instead ask yourself this: **What do I desire?** Then take risks to get there! And if you fail at first, that’s okay! We shouldn’t be fearing failure, or rejecting the thoughts of taking risks, instead we should be embracing them. Because the lessons we learn from these experiences are the *driving forces* towards success.
